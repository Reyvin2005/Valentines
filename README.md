Dear Baobao,
My Lovey, thank you for being the sweetest person that I love so much. I love you so much!

I can truly say that when I am with you, I can be myself. My true self wasn’t always seen by everyone but with you I could finally be seen. I can cry without worry. I can be the crazy and cringey boy that I am. 

I never would have imagined that I could find someone who gets me, who loves me the way I am. I never even imagined it would be the prettiest girl ever. But I got it all with you my love.

Marifern Perlas, I thank you for all the love and encouragement that you’ve given me. I appreciate you in everything that you do! Loving you has been the greatest gift I have ever received. 


I love you so much my lovey!!! Thank you for being the girl that I am so proud of. My sweet and caring girl. My amazing girl. Here’s to more chapters with you my love. More memories that we will create. 

I just want to be with you every single day for the rest of our lives.

Can you be my Valentine?

P.S. Kala mo ikaw lang may pasurprise hehe
